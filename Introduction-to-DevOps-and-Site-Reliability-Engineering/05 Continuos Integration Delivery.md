# 05 Continuous Integration (CI) Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment (CD) 
**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a software development practice focused on regularly merging code modifications from development teams into a central repository. Its primary objective is to identify and resolve integration problems at an early stage of the development cycle and it emphasizes frequent code integration, automated building and testing procedures.
**Continuous Delivery (CD)** is a software development practice that aims to automate the process of releasing software changes to production environments in a frequent and reliable manner. It builds upon the concept of Continuous Integration (CI) by extending the automated pipeline to include deployment and release processes. In continuous delivery, the goal is to have software in a state where it can be released to production at any given time.

## What Is Continuous Integration (CI)?
Continuous Integration (CI) is a pivotal methodology in software development, reshaping the way teams collaborate and deliver high-quality code. At its core, CI involves the regular merging of code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. This iterative process serves as a proactive measure to identify and rectify integration issues at an early stage, fostering a development environment characterized by stability and efficiency. The build process includes tasks such as code compilation, automated testing, and the creation of executable artifacts. The automation ensures that the codebase is consistently and reliably built, reducing variability and ensuring a standardized output.  

Automated testing is another integral component of CI. Developers leverage various types of tests, including unit tests and integration tests, to validate the correctness of their code. This emphasis on automated testing serves a dual purpose: it verifies that the newly integrated code functions as expected, and it provides a safety net for catching regressions and defects.

A key feature of CI is the immediate feedback loop. Developers receive prompt notifications about the success or failure of their code integration. This rapid feedback allows for quick identification and resolution of issues, preventing the accumulation of defects that could lead to more complex problems down the line.
