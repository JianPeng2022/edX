## What Is Serverless?
Serverless is an abstract term, and it is not meant to be taken literally, although many do. In the same way that Cloud Computing does not invoke the sky, serverless does not involve code executing without servers. It merely refers to the experience a user or customer has and represents a continuum of how close one needs to work with hardware and infrastructure.
