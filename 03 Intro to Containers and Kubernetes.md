# 03 Introduction to Containers and Kubernetes
Imagine a container as a standardized box that holds everything your application needs to run - its code, libraries, runtime environment, and system configuration. Unlike virtual machines, which virtualize the entire hardware stack, containers share the underlying operating system (OS) with other containers, making them much more lightweight and efficient.
## The Difference Between Containers and Virtual Machines
Virtual machines provide a fully isolated virtual environment, complete with an operating system and all necessary dependencies. Each VM runs on a hypervisor, a layer that abstracts the physical hardware and allows multiple VMs to coexist on a single physical machine. Here are some key characteristics of virtual machines:
- **Strong isolation**: Each VM operates as an independent entity, with its own dedicated resources and a separate OS instance. This isolation makes VMs highly secure, as vulnerabilities within one VM do not impact others.
- **Compatibility**: Virtual machines can run different operating systems within the same hardware. This makes VMs versatile and allows for running legacy applications or different operating system versions in parallel.
- **Complete abstraction**: VMs completely abstract the underlying hardware, providing hardware-level virtualization. This means VMs operate as if they are running on dedicated physical machines, giving them full control over the virtual environment.
- **Resource overhead**: VMs consume more resources compared to containers due to the need for a separate OS instance for each VM. This can result in higher infrastructure costs and slower startup times compared to containers.

Containers provide a way to package and run applications with their dependencies, isolated from the underlying host system. The core idea behind containers is to offer a lightweight and highly efficient alternative to traditional VMs. Here are some key characteristics of containers:
- **Resource efficiency**: Containers share the host system's operating system (OS) kernel, eliminating the need for multiple OS instances. This reduces the overhead and frees up resources, making containers significantly more resource-efficient compared to VMs.
- **Rapid startup and scalability**: Containers can start and stop almost instantaneously, often in seconds. This rapid startup time makes them highly scalable and allows for horizontal scaling, meaning you can easily spin up multiple instances of an application to handle an increased workload.
- **Isolation and security**: Containers are isolated from one another and from the host system, providing strong isolation of resources. However, since they share the OS kernel, a vulnerability in the kernel can potentially affect all containers running on the host.
- **Ease of management**: Containers are easier to manage due to their lightweight nature. They can be deployed, updated, and rolled back effortlessly, making them ideal for applications that require frequent updates and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) workflows.
